	This is a suite of subroutines to simplify using balanced Binary Trees

Files Changed	:
=================
	None.


To Build	:
=================
	Since this is not a comlete program, the functions should be included

	The makefile included is to complete the demonstration program called
t_trtest. This is a worked example.

Make test


To Install Demo	:
=================

Make insta
