<H2> DESCRIPTION </H2>
These functions create and manipulate a balanced binary (AVL) tree.  Each node
of the tree contains the expected left & right subtree pointers, a short-int
balance indicator, and a pointer to the user-data.  On a 32-bit system, this
means an overhead of 4+4+2+4 bytes per node (or, on a RISC or otherwise
alignment-constrained system with implied padding, 4+4+4+4 bytes per node).
There is no key data type enforced by this package; a caller-supplied
compare routine is used to compare user-data blocks.<P>

Balanced binary trees are very fast on searches and replacements, but have a
moderately high cost for additions and deletions.  If your application does a
lot more searches and replacements than it does additions and deletions, the
balanced (AVL) binary tree is a good choice for a data structure.<P>
<P>
<HR>
<B>Tree_init</B>
creates an empty tree and binds it to tree (which for this and all other
routines in this package should be declared as a pointer to void or int, and
passed by reference), which can then be used by other routines in this package.
Note that more than one tree variable can exist at once; thus multiple 
trees can be manipulated simultaneously.<P>
<HR>
<B>Tree_srch</B> searches a tree for a specific node and returns either NULL 
if no node was found, or the value of the user-data pointer if the node was 
found. compare is the address of a function to compare two user-data 
blocks. This routine should work much the way strcmp 2 does; in fact, strcmp 
could be used if the user-data was a null-terminated string. data is the 
address of a user-data block to be used by compare as the  search criteria.  
The tree is searched for a node where compare returns 0.<P>
<HR>
<B>Tree_add</B> inserts or replaces a node in the specified tree. The tree 
specified by tree is searched as in <B>tree_srch</B>, and if a node is
found to match data, then the <B>del_uar</B> function is called with the 
address of the user-data block for the node (this routine should deallocate any 
dynamic memory which is referenced exclusively by the node); the user-data 
pointer for the node is then replaced by the value of data. If no node is found
to match, a new node is added (which may or may not cause a transparent 
rebalance operation), with a user-data pointer equal to data. A rebalance may or
may not occur, depending on where the node is added and what the rest of the 
tree looks like.<P>
<HR>
<B>Tree_delete</B> deletes a node from tree.
A rebalance may or may not occur, depending on where the node is removed from
and what the rest of the tree looks like. <B>Tree_delete</B> returns TRUE if a 
node was deleted, FALSE otherwise.<P>
<HR>
<B>Tree_trav</B> traverses all of tree, calling trav_uar with the address of 
each user-data block. If trav_uar returns FALSE at any time, tree_trav will 
immediately return FALSE to its caller. Otherwise all nodes will be reached and 
tree_trav will return TRUE. <P>
<HR>
<B>Tree_mung</B> deletes every node in tree, calling <B>del_uar</B> with the 
user-data address from each node (see <B>tree_add</B>and <B>tree_delete</B>
above).  The tree is left in the same state that <B>tree_init</B> leaves it in
\- i.e., empty.<P>
