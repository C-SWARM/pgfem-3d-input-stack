        Dear friend,

This directory tree contains a C-language toolkit (Ckit), which consists of
a number of useful packages.  These are made into a single support library.
The core of the Ckit is a list processing package (formerly C-toolkit) by
Robert A Zimmermann.  It helped me to build my programs faster and more
comfortably.  I have also contributed some minor modifications (the largest
being probably the consistent use of prototypes everywhere) and the
packages tokensP, vectP and skyP.  The changes are clearly indicated in the
source.  I had however no possibility to include their description in the
manual (see the docs directory).  Therefore, they are described separately.

I had unfortunately also a few problems with the memory management
routines.  They do not seem to be working correctly under Sun (SunOS),
and HP/9000 series 700 (HP-UX).  Therefore, I have included the macro
flag "STANDARD_MALLOC" in ./include/ckitcfg.h by default.  


The tokensP package has been extracted from some public domain software.  I
have adjusted its behaviour, and I have enhanced its front-end by a number
of token access routines for more convenience.


The vectP package is due to "2d and 3d Vector C Library" by Andrew Glassner
from "Graphics Gems", Academic Press, 1990.  I have adjusted the naming of
the routines and of the data types, so that it can be used without name
clashes.  I have also added a simple renaming system, so that you can call
the routines anything you want by writing a set of macros (see the vectP.h
include file).


The skyP package is a skyline solver for large sparse systems, which
typically occur in finite element applications.  The core of the package is
an automatically generated rewrite of the Bathe's COLSOL routine into C.
An object oriented wrapper has been added, and the interface has been adjusted
for information hiding.


Installation
==============================================================================

There is a configure script in the ./src directory (generated by
autoconf).  Run this script.  The Makefile is generated.  Then run
"make all" to build the library.
