To install the converter do the following

1. `$cd ./src`
2. `make depend tags all`
3. Add .../src/con3d++ to your PATH variable

You may wish to modify the compile flags for production use. This may
be done at the command line by adding, e.g., 'CFLAGS="-g -O3 -Wall"'
to the 'make' command.

See `con3d++ -h` and other documentation for information on how to run
the code.
